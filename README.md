Pur1fy -> Public Repo --> SUPER EARLY WORK IN PROGRESS. BABY STEPS.

CLI Tool in Golang aimed at CyberSec!
The goals are to consume relevant apis, and perform scans automatically, saving you time and also auto generating a report. 

## How to run
Run the program in any shell with go installed locally. 
```bash
go run main.go
```

#### TO-DO LIST for Dev:
----------------
1. Replace this toy api with Shodan API and Searchsploit/some CVE API available.
2. Display shortened results
3. Automate Scans based on url and keywords for shodan / google dorking maybe?
4. see how to generate a report in .md file ideally.
